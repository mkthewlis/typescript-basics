// There is the option to be specific, but better to allow TS to infer value types
// const person: {
//     name: string;
//     age: number;
// } = {

// However, it can be needed when wanting to override TS's own inferrence, eg. when setting 
// an array to specifically be a tuple. Otherwise, the following would work below the object:
// person.role.push('admin');
// person.role[1] = 10;
// To avoid this, the object can be added again to specify what type role should be:

// const person: {
//     name: string;
//     age: number;
//     hobbies: string[];
    // This sets role to be a tuple with exactly two elements of these types:
//     role: [number, string];
// } = {
//     name: 'Bob',
//     age: 28,
//     hobbies: ['Sports', 'Cooking'],
//     role: [2, 'Author']
// };

// Enums assign labels to numbers. Begin by declaring the enum then accessing it globally
// Declare enums, often written in capital letters
enum Role { ADMIN, READ_ONLY, AUTHOR };

// Can also include specifics to override 1, 2, 3 etc
// enum Role { ADMIN = 'Admin', READ_ONLY = 5, AUTHOR = 100};

const person = {
    name: 'Bob',
    age: 28,
    hobbies: ['Sports', 'Cooking'],
    role: Role.ADMIN
};

// Use any[] to let the content of the array be anything
let favouriteActivities: string[];
favouriteActivities = ['Sports'];
// This leads to error as it is not an array:
// favouriteActivities = 'Sports';
// This leads to an error as it includes a number:
// favouriteActivies = ['Sports, 1];

// person.nickname would not work as the key doesn't exist
console.log(person.name);

for (const hobby of person.hobbies) {
    console.log(hobby.toUpperCase());
    // However, this would fail as map only works on number arrays:
    // console.log(hobby.map(...));
}

if (person.role === Role.AUTHOR) {
    console.log('is author')
};
